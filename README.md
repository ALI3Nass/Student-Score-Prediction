#Linear Regression Model for Predicting Student Scores
##This is a machine learning model implemented in Python using popular libraries such as scikit-learn (sklearn), NumPy, and Pandas. The model is designed to predict the scores of students based on the number of hours they study. The data used to train and test the model is sourced from a CSV file containing information about the number of hours students studied and their corresponding scores.

##Usage
To use this model, first, clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-model.git

Then navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

You can then use the trained model to predict the scores of new students based on the number of hours they study.

##Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find a bug or have a suggestion for how to improve the model, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
